# Nonholonomic-Control
In this project, we develop controllers for a second order nonholonomic system using two methods. We first try to control the system directly on its Lie algebra with a Bang-Bang controller. Then we utilize the steering with sinusoids method [1] to do more efficient open and closed loop control. We use these controllers to move a Turtle Bot that is constrained to the bicycle model.
A video of Turtlebot being controlled can be found on YouTube.
